title: 2D Multiplayer Game!
---
This game is a 2D minecraft inspired multiplayer game. I created it using GLM, GLAD, GLFW, and ENET. It is made up of one chunck, 16 wide, and 384 tall. The player is able to connect to a server. Once connected the user is able to place and break blocks.

Run instructions
Inside the Build folder there is a server and client folder. First run the server.exe. Then launch the client. When the client window first opens it will be white. Click on the command promp that also opens and enter the servers ip address. Then the port: 7777.
